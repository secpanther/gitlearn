# Conf Notes

Tuesday, 29 May 2018

Questions to consider for debriefing
	- Conference value? Tutorials offer a deeper dive learning opportunity
	- Who should attend?
	- What are the emerging trends?
	- What could/should be implemented straight away?
		○ Catalogue of Risks, Controls/Treatments, Consequences,  
	- Validation of our current security culture/maturity/posture?
	- Networking?

Day 1
	- Registered, missed Tutorial (GDPR session 9am-5pm)
	- Left at 3pm

Day 2
	- Security Risk Assessment Tutorial
		○ ISO 31000, 27005
		○ Find out Risk appetite of the organisation - collectively across the enterprise
		○ Three lines of defense model (revert to slide deck)

Day 3

Software development security
	- Bandit (python static analysis)
	- Raise with device teams, get them onboard and 'bake in' security.

ISAR (awareness raising)
	- Force dissolvers, leaders who don't follow rules, processes and policies that don't make sense, practices that contradict.
	- Tangible threats e.g stories, case studies
	- Learning fatigue counter e.g security awareness following induction not during induction for better understanding, engagement and knowledge retention.
	- Short lecture, combined frequent interaction, two way communication.
	- Metrics, how to measure! Reporting is important, user incident reports one way. Phishing campaign aimed at staff following awareness training vs staff who have not.
	- How to measure engagement, post-training survey.
	- What works. Videos, mixed cohorts, mornings, clear narrow exercises.
	- Pitch messages in positive light, negative can shut off attention.

Cyber risk insurance and logging for forensics
	- Insurance services E.g response, PR campaign, brand protection, status and notifications.
	- Log trifecta e.g netflows, DNS queries, networks.

SAP attack and defense
	- SE80 audit log bypass. Commands performed under SE80 are not logged

Day 4

Bug bounty keynote
	- Don't directly improve security
	- Must be well thought out and planned e.g NDA, boundaries, rules, third party protection, ability to triage and respond.

Email keynote (MIMECAST)
	- 90% initial attack vector
	- Evolution of email attack e.g virus spam, links, social engineering
	- Backup of hosted services often forgotten or not considered important as "the cloud will always be available"

Patching - vulnerability mitigation life cycle
	- Documentation e.g end to end process, CMDB, asset attributes/profile
	- Single platform for teams e.g. security team and ICT support.

Log streaming and threat hunting (NSS Labs)
	- Realtime log parser tools?
	- Global log format?
	- Planning, log value using identified attack methods and working back
	- Run samples to determine effectiveness of the solution e.g search, alert, dashboards, monitoring toolset

Topics (Kafka) for consumer (end user) subscription. Linked with annotation engine.

Micro segmentation
	- PoC tools
	- What to segment?
	- Mapping process e.g netflow, service execution, application flow/documentation.
	- Step/phased process

IoT
